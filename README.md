### Articial Neural Network use for SONAR SYSTEM
# ANN Model
**Sonar Project**

*Hello, I have created a training model using artificial neural networks in my project.
Unlike the regular models, this model was realized by integrating a minimum number of libraries into my project. 
In other words, I did not use the libraries in which extensive machine learning algorithms such as tensorflow and keras were used in my project,
and I defined the functions myself and performed the operations within these functions.
Attributes and observations of cylindrical rocks and cylindrical mines are included in the sonar dataset that I used in my project. 
The most basic and most necessary purpose in preparing the project was to make a classification so that these cylindrical mines and cylindrical rocks can be distinguished from each other. 
I aimed to classify my classification model by creating an artificial neural network topology, not machine learning algorithms, by training it thanks to this artificial neural network.
The topology of the artificial neural network that I have used, on the other hand, is applied for the forward propagation algorithm, back propagation algorithm and each of the error margins in the construction of the multi-layer artificial neural network (MLP), the artificial neural network with the input layer, the middle layer and the output layer.
The algorithms and margins of error I mentioned were created as functions in my project and called where necessary after the model formation phase.*
